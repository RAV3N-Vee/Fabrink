# Fabrink
The Apparel and Clothing Industry has undergone exorbitant changes in recent years. The industry has risen to be one of the most profitable and bankable niches in the business world. 

But, there are some issues that are yet to be addressed. The most common issues are manufacturing and storing an immense amount of clothes and apparel without any assurance that the stock will all be sold, investing in real estate and related resources that are required for stocking and maintaining the stock, and the most important point is that every customer has his requirement and budget and it is extremely difficult for manufacturers to cater to the needs of individual customers.

Another problem we have encountered is that around 85% of all textiles produced by the fashion industry end up in landfills, making it a major contributor to environmental damage. One in every five garments reaches a landfill without being worn even once.

Pertaining to the aforementioned issues we have discovered that a lot of complications in the apparel business cycle can be resolved by implementing the PRINT ON DEMAND Model. By choosing Print-on-Demand, we choose apparel that's created only as the order is placed, creating less fabric waste than conventional manufacturing. 

We at FabrInk are implementing this model in our business, which will not only help us reach various small businesses and help them grow and build a brand but also we will be able to pass on various benefits to the end consumer.

# Proposed System

## 1. Business Plan

FabrInk is based on the Print-On-Demand Business Model in which the apparels are printed only after the order is received from a customer or Brand Owner.
After the order is received :
The Design Uploaded by the customer is checked for any Copyright Infringement Issues or violation of terms before printing.
If the design is found to comply with the terms then it is printed on the chosen apparel by our Printers and the Required Brand Logo is also printed.
The ready product is thoroughly checked for any quality issues and print consistency.
After the pre-delivery inspection is done the product is finally sent for packaging from where it will be shipped to the customer directly.
For any assistance after the product has been delivered to the customer, he/she can reach out to us where they will be guided by our Customer Support Team.

## 2. Revenue Model

The Three Primary sources of revenue for FabrInk:

Orders received from the Website
Orders received from the Website shall be fulfilled by the Printer as and when the order is placed. The updates regarding that shall be posted on the website. In the case of orders received from the website, we will have profit margins ranging from 30-35%

## 3. Custom Bulk Orders (B2B)
Various brands/groups can approach us for their custom bulk orders which shall be fulfilled from a warehouse where the printer is located. These orders shall be shipped using Third-Party shipping services.
The profit margin in bulk orders differs from every order due to various parameters like Client-requirements, Quantity, Design Specifications, Apparel Quality, etc. But we will try and maintain a margin of around 25-30% on the total billing amount.

## 4. Design Services
Design services shall be offered to Customers who need a Custom Design prepared at additional Costs

## Conclusion

The Project has helped us in understanding Business Processes and the use of Web-applications in implementation of business in real-life scenarios. It has also helped us broaden our perspective regarding entrepreneurship and environmental concerns. We were also introduced to the potency of  Web-Based Business Models and their extensive impact on our day to day activities.  

We are of the firm opinion that FabrInk is a great innovation in Printed Apparel Business and that it will help simplify the entire process of Printing and Delivering printed Clothing to Customers if it is implemented with due diligence. It will not only help reduce the ghastly effects on the environment that are inflicted by traditional practices in the clothing industry but also will help small brand owners to generate good revenue which in turn will help FabrInk scale up its own revenue.
